## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/chakrabar/chakrabar.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

OR

* Bulleted
* List

1. Numbered
2. List
    1. Sub
    2. List
3. Continue

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)

```

//comment >> [comment]: # (This is one of the most common syntax for comments)

Code block within `` ```<code>``` ``. For more specific syntax highlighting, e.g. for C# use `` ```cs <code> ``` ``. See sample below

1. Simple code block highlight
```
public class CoolClass
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Id => 101;

    public CoolClass(string name, int id) => (Name, Id) = (name, id);
}
```

2. Code block with syntax highlighting
```cs
public class CoolClass
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Id => 101;

    public CoolClass(string name, int id) => (Name, Id) = (name, id);
}
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/chakrabar/chakrabar.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
