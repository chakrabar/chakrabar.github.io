//TODO: Brief intro - why? distributed systems.

## Message Broker

//TODO: Overall flow/structure needs rework

A message broker is a intermediary between services that works on message based communication. It runs as a background application and services interact with it through APIs, and it acts like a `Messaging Queue` or `MQ`. Generally services send messages targeted for another one or more service, and the target system(s) pick them up from the Messaging Queue when it wants. Until that, the message sits with the message broker.

Typical use cases or Message Broker:

1. Microservices or SOA (disjoint independent services communicate via MQ)
2. Integrating legacy applications with loss-less data passing
3. Powering dashboards, aggregators or reports that need to get data from many sources
4. Simplifying complex monoliths (e.g. break down a big monolith into services, step-by-step), while keeping them decoupled

Common messaging Patterns:

1. Point-to-point asynchronous: Messages act like commands and the source fires & forgets, does not wait for a response.
2. Point-to-point synchronous: Works more like a RPC. The destination sends back a response message, and source waits for it.
3. Broadcasting: Message sent to all services that are listening. The target services have to subscribe to the event, works on a publish-subscribe model.
4. Multicasting: Message sent to bunch of services. Target subscribers are chosen based on some configuration like routing-key or binding.

###### Benefits of MQs

* Durability (persisted, data not lost on failure)
* Asynchorny (producer-consumer need not be active at same time)
* Decoupled (producer-consumer need not talk directly or know each other)
* Resilience (systems can come back after failure and continue)
* Delivery guarantee (different reliability options)
* Delivery order (FIFO)
* Buffering (messaging rate need not match between components)
* Scalability (scale up, and scale out with clustering)

## RabbitMQ

![image-right](/images/posts/misc/rabbitmq-logo.jpg){: .pull-right}
RabbitMQ is the most widely used Messaging Queue till date, and usable across many OS & technology platforms. Main features of RabbitMQ are

* It is a widely popular message broker/messaging queue
* Cross-platform & Open Source (also available with commercial support)
* Written in `Erlang`. Was originally developed in Ericsson for telecom domain
* Uses standardized messaging protocol: AMQP (Advanced Message Queueing Protocol) v 0.9.1
* Has many technology specific clients like - `Java`, `.NET`, `Erlang`, `Ruby`, `Golang`, `Node` etc.
* Supports clustering for high availability, scalability & fail-over

RabbitMQ needs Erlang runtime to run. Runs as a  service on Windows. Does not have GUI by default, but management plugin can be installed separately to use the web based management portal.

###### Management portal features

* Declare, list & delete entities
* Queue & exchange monitoring
* Send & receive messages
* Monitoring the backend process
* Force close connections & purge queues

#### MSMQ vs RabbitMQ

On Windows systems, the `MSMQ` comes as default and it has been used a lot as a generic purpose MQ. let's quickly see how it compares with RabbitMQ.

* MSMQ works on Windows only, while RabbitMQ is cross-platform. Works on Windows, Linux systems, macOS, AWS, Azure, Docker etc.
* RabbitMQ is centralized, means there is only one (or a cluster) central server. MSMQ is de-centralized, all participating systems need to have it's own queue.
* RabbitMQ uses standard AMQP protocol.

If the needs is only for Windows based systems and all components can have own MQ instance, MSMQ works fine. But RabbitMQ is much more standardized and comes with lot of benefits and flexibilities.

#### Installation

* Go to the RabbitMQ [download page](https://www.rabbitmq.com/download.html)
* Select your OS. For Windows, go to [Windows installer](https://www.rabbitmq.com/install-windows.html) and download from GitHub or the other source (do NOT install yet)
* Check Erlang version compatibility [here](https://www.rabbitmq.com/which-erlang.html)
* Download a compatible Erlang version e.g. [v20.3](http://www.erlang.org/downloads/20.3)
* Download e.g. "OTP 20.3 Windows 64-bit Binary File" and install (as Admin)
* Install the RabbitMQ server that was downloaded (as Admin). Allow firewall access if required

Once installed, RabbitMQ service will run automatically. RabbitMQ does not enable the management portal by default. To enable

* Open command prompt
* Go to RabbitMQ installation directory e.g. C:\Program Files\RabbitMQ Server\rabbitmq_server-3.7.6\sbin
* Run command &gt;&gt; rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_management
* After installation (enabling), restart the RabbitMQ message broker (RabbitMQ service in Windows) to use the management portal
* Once completed, it can be accesses at `http://localhost:15672`. Default credential is guest/guest

#### RabbitMQ Architecture

A client application connects to RabbitMQ message broker service with a _**Connection**_. A connection can hold a bunch of _**Channels**_. These channels provide concurrency. Ideally, each thread in service application should use a separate channel, whereas a connection can be shared.

The client application that sends data is called a _**producer**_ or _**publisher**_.

It sends messages over wire, using `AMQP` protocol to a RabbitMQ _**Exchange**_. The exchange does not store data, it routes it to one or more _**Queue**_ or exchange, using a _**Binding**_. A binding consists of, (generally) a queue, an exchange and a routing-key.

A service that is interested in getting a message is a _**Consumer**_. It watches/monitors the queue(s).
If a consumer successfully consumes a message, it (generally) sends back an _**Ack**_ or acknowledgment to the queue. Once acknowledgment is received, the message is removed from queue. But this acknowledgment configuration can be changes to no-acknowledgment as well.

Messages have _**Routing-Key**_, that is a string value used to match recipients. It would have words with optional dots like "order" or "customer.order.premium". This is used to deliver messages to specific queues with matching key.

A typical RabbitMQ connection string looks like "amqp://guest:guest @localhost:5672/" (where guest/guest is the default credentials).

A message has body and properties like content type, and other optional parts like headers , expiration etc. It can have a custom "correlationId" (ideally a GUID) to be used as a message identifier. To publish a message, minimum required are - exchange, routing-key, message properties, and the message body as byte array. RabbitMQ messages are stored & transported as binary data.

To receive messages, client needs to create a channel, specifying a queue & other properties.
Channel has basic QoS (Quality of Service) like if messages are pre-fetched etc.

Since a whole distributed system depends on it, and it might become a single point of failure! It should be protected with _**clustering**_ to have high availability and fail-safe operation.

#### AMQP

//TODO: More details

AMQP is the protocol used behind RabbitMQ. It's a messaging protocol for standard MQs.

* Advanced Message Queueing Protocol. A network protocol that supports clients connecting to compatible messaging queues.
* (Publisher) --> [ Message broker :: (Exchange) -routes-> (Queue) ] --> (Consumer)
* Once consumer receives the message, it sends back an acknowledgement. On receiving the acknowledgement, broker removes the message from the queue.

###### Components

```fs
(Publisher) --> [ Message broker | (Exchange) --routes--> (Queue) ] --> (Consumer)
```

* Exchanges - exchanges recieve messages and then route them to one or more queues. Exchanges have properties like name, durability, auto-delete etc.
* Queues - queues are FIFO message stores inside the messaging broker. They receive messages from the exchange based on routing. Messages have properties like name, durable (bool: if persisted on disk, apart from memory - fail safe), exclusive (one connection one consumer, delete queue connection closes), auto-delete (delete queue when all consumers unsubscribe)
* Bindings - defines how messages are sent from exchanges to queues. Sometimes has a routing-key that is string, used to match target queues
* Consumers - applications that read messages from the broker. They subscribe to queues. AMQP provides multiple ways to define when messages are deleted, like when they are received by consumer, or when the consumer sends back acknowledgement etc. A consumer can also reject a message if it is not able to process it. Then the broker can discard or requeue (put back in same position) the message.

###### Exchanges types

* **Direct** - A message is sent directly to one or more queue from a exchange, where the binding key matches exactly the message routing key. If there are named instances of queues, messages can have that name-key as routing-key. So that the message is only sent to queue(s) with a matching name as the routing-key. e.g. "order", "customer" etc.
* **Fanout** - Delivers message to all queues that are bound to it. Routing key is ignored. Used for broadcasting.
* **Topic** - Sends messages to one or more queues based on pattern matching of the routing key. Commonly used for multicast messaging. Ver powerful and flexible. The routing key in message is multiple words with dots like "customer.order.premium". The routing-key in queues can have wild card pattern to match like "customer.order.*" or "customer.#" where * stands for a single word, # for multiple words. It can also have the full key.
* **Headers** - Messages are routed based on headers values rather than routing key. Headers are key-value pairs. Queues can have one or multiple header key-value pairs to match.

## RabbitMQ client library

We'll look at the .NET client library here. With this, a .NET application can inetract with a RabbitMQ server by making connections & channels. It can declare exchanges, queues, binding and send & receive messages.

The earlier versions of the client can be downloaded from [here](https://www.rabbitmq.com/dotnet.html). Newer versions are available exclusively through [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RabbitMQ.Client). The current versions are .NET Core compliant.

The main componenets/features are

* IModel - AMQP data channel, provides AMQP operations
* IConnection - an AMQP connection to message broker
* ConnectionFactory - constructs IConnection instances
* ConnectionParameters - ConnectionFactory configurations
* QueueingBasicConsumer - receives message from server

**Note:** RabbitMQ stores and sends messages in binary format as byte array `byte[]`. How to convert the data to and from binary is up to design. If standard binary format is used like base64 encoded JSON string or ProtoBuf, it can work acorss all platforms. In AMQP general standard, "content-type" and "content-encoding" fields/headers are used to communicate this info. For .NET only use cases, the model class/POCOs can have `[Serializable]` attribute and  binary serialization can be used.
{: .notice--info}

//TODO: Correct & latest code samples

```cs
//Install-Package RabbitMQ.Client

ConnectionFactory factory = new ConnectionFactory { HostName = "localhost", UserName = "guest", Password = "guest" };
IConnection connection = factory.CreateConnection(); //create a connection
IModel model = connection.CreateModel(); //create a channel

//create if does not exist
model.ExchangeDeclare("MyExchangeName", "direct"); //a diret exchange
model.QueueDeclare("MyQueueName");
model.QueueBind("MyQueueName", "MyExchangeName", ""); //empty routing key

//publish message
model.BasicPublish("", queueName, null, message.Serialize()); //"" uses the default exchange

//receive messages
var consumer = new QueueingBasicConsumer(model);
model.BasicConsume(queueName, true, consumer); //noAck=true
//get message example below

//consume with basic acknowledgement
model.BasicQos(0, 1, false); //Quality of Service, get acknowledgement
model.BasicConsume(queueName, false, consumer); //noAck=false
var messageBytes = consumer.Queue.Dequeue();
var message = messageBytes.Body.Deserealize(); //get back message
model.BasicAck(messageBytes.DeliveryTag, false); //send acknowledgement
```

#### Some standard queue types

//TODO: Clean & tidy up

###### Worker Queue

A queue setup with multiple consumers mostly to benefit from load balancing between consumers. They can have direct exchange, sending message to a queue and <u>multiple consumers bound to same (single) queue</u>. Consumers send back acknowledgement to say when to remove a message. If not ack-ed, the message is re-queued (put back in the same position, not at the end of the queue).

In direct exchange (not fanout), if multiple consumer bind to same queue, only one of the consumer gets the message. Messages are sent to either of the consumers in round robin way. This works like a _task queue_ where tasks are distributed equally to workers.

###### Publisher Subscriber Queue

Multiple consumers, but everyone receives every message. <u>Separate queues are used for each consumer</u>, and a `fanout` exchange is used to send messages to all queues.

```cs
model.ExchangeDeclare(exchangeName, "fanout", true); //fanout & durable, persisted on disk
model.BasicPublish(exchangeName, "", null, message.Serialize()); //"" to indicate all queues bound to the exchange

model.BasicConsume(queueName, true, consumer);
```

###### Direct Routing

Sends to multiple consumers with direct exchange with specific routing key. <u>Only the ones with correct routing key (queueName) gets the message</u>.

```cs
//producer
model.ExchangeDeclare(exchangeName, "direct");

model.QueueDeclare(CardPaymentQueueName, true, false, false, null); //true:queue is persisted
model.QueueDeclare(PurchaseOrderQueueName, true, false, false, null); //same, durable queue

model.QueueBind(CardPaymentQueueName, exchangeName, "CardPayment");
model.QueueBind(PurchaseOrderQueueName, exchangeName, "PurchaseOrder");

//one consumer
model.ExchangeDeclare(exchangeName, "direct");
model.QueueDeclare(CardPaymentQueueName, true, false, false, null);
model.QueueBind(CardPaymentQueueName, exchangeName, "CardPayment");
```

###### Remote procedure Call

The client (producer) and server (consumer) communictaes through queue. Rather than exchange, they talk directly to the queues. There are 2 queues in opposite direction, <u>one request-queue for message from client to the server, and a response-queue for response from server to the client</u>. They request and response are generally matched through a common custom header (like process_id = 1231), and the whole process works synchronously.

#### Advanced options with RabbitMQ

###### Scheduling

Needs [RabbitMQ delayed message plugin](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-delayed-message-exchange/). It adds a new exchange type _"x-delayed-type"_, that has capability to _delay_ a message delivery.

To delay a message in the x-delayed-type exchange type, send messages with a special header _"x-delay"_ with an integer value, that represents how many milliseconds the message will be delayed. This delay will apply to the message delivery exchange-to-queue or another exchange.

If you want to schedule a message at a specific time, interval or something more complex, use an external scheduler to schedule the message push to the RabbitMQ. Something like a default scheduler on Windows or a cron job on Linux can be used.

###### Clustering

Clusters of RabbitMQ message brokers can be created by having multiple instances of them and connecting them through their address (e.g. hostname & port) in some configuration files. The nodes (message broker instances) must be able to connect to each other in order to form [cluster](https://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html).

Generally there's no master/slave*, and all nodes are considered peers. They maintain consistency through replication. Data & state are replicated by default, but not queues. Exchanges, bindings etc. are replicated to all nodes.

To replicate queues, _"queue mirroring"_ needs to be configured. The node on which the queue was declared, works as master* and the mirrored queues works as mirrors. Irrespective of which node a client is connected to, messages are always sent to master queue then mirrored to others. This enhances availablity but does NOT distribute load. If the master node fails, oldest mirror is promoted as master.

The clients can connect to any of the nodes. Generally a list of addresses are configured in client connection, so that it can connect to other nodes if one/more are not available. When a node comes back from failure, it joins the cluster back and sync up from other nodes.

###### Message persistance

Persistent messages are written to disk as soon as they arrive. On the other hand, transient messages can also be written to disk in case of memory pressure, so that those can be recovered afterwards. Persistent messages are also kept in memory for better performance.

Messages are persisted on RabbitMQ's own database based on index and message storages.

To make it actually safe, [1] the exchange & queue has to be declared _durable_, so that they will be recreated after a failure/restart, and [2] the messages has to be declared _persistent_, so that they are persisted in memory and can be recreated inside durable queues. But, also remember, making things persitent also makes the whole system comparatively slower because of the disk I/O.

###### RabbitMQ reliability options

//TODO: More details & clarity

* Acks: Acknowledgement with specific deliveryID (delivery tag). Until consumer sends back acknowledgement, message is not deleted.
* Publisher confirms: Producer gets an acknowledgement back when message is queued. If "Nack" or no-acknowledgement, a strategy needs to be put in place for retry. There is no in-bult timeout.
* Mandatory flag, bool: Unsuccessful messages are sent back ?
* Reply to sender: send an reply back to producer, when consumer gets message. Needs some RPC type strategy
* Connection & topology recover: Automatically reopens channels, binding etc on fail-over

Virtual hosts: RabbitMQ can be configured to host independent systems on the same by on separate virtual hosts, for separation & security. They are named instances and be configured through connection string.

RabbitMQ security is based on users and their permissions. And about dead queue - messages are sent to _"dead letter exchange (DLX)"_ when messages are failed, or rejected or abandoned because of exceeding queue length.
