## `TypeScript`

Source of information [here](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/typescript-in-depth/table-of-contents
).

What is `TypeScript`

* A programming language, a superset of `JavaScript`
* It compiles to `JavaScript`, that can run on modern browsers (client-side) or in `node` (server-side)
* Provides type-safety and higher level programming constructs over `JavaScript`
