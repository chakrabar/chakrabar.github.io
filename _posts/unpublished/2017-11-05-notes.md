## To improve

1. Threading, tasks, async-await :: WIP => Tasks, multithreading, async-await, Left => Concurrent collections
2. Build systems, CI/CD :: Yep => NAnt, GoCD
3. No-SQL databases :: WIP => Neo4j, Left => Elasticsearch, MongoDB
4. System architecture ??
5. .NET specific
  1. Expression trees
  2. Closure
  3. Code contracts
6. Git
7. Akka.NET ([reactive extensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/dotnet/reactive-extensions/hh242985(v=vs.103)))
8. Microservices, Event-sourcing etc.
9. .NET Core
  1. Deployment
  2. Security
10. Containers revisit

  3. Packing .NET applications

Maybe later...

6. Functional programming basics

## To write

1. Coding guidelines (old)
2. async-await - done
3. Deadlock, with task based models (to learn better) - included in multi-threading
4. Why our View Models suck? Are full-stack engineers really helping us?
5. Blog - 90's middleclass life :)
