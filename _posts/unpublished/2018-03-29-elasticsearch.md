# Elasticsearch

#### What is Elasticsearch?

A distributed schema-less database with very fast full-text search capabilities

* A wrapper over Lucene (written in Java), as a distributed system with http interface - that is very fast & scalable
* At heart, the actual work is done by Lucene which provides full-text search
* Works as a JSON-based full-text no-sql DB
* Returns text-search result based on relevance, also creates analytics on data

Why? Very fast, result ordered by relevance, statistical trends in data
When? Blogs, Logs, unstructured document data (e.g. to provide text suggestion)

#### Architecture

* Data is stored as `JSON documents`
* A `Type` is a collection of similar documents (li'l like tables in relation database)
* Types are stored as `Index` (similar to DB in relational DB)
* Indices are sliced into `Shards`, which are nothing but chunk of data from an index - each shard is one instance of `Lucene`
* Shards are stored in multiple `Nodes` (Node = Elasticsearch server), forming an easily scalable `Cluster`
* Elasticsearch can make copies of index shards, which are called `Replicas`

For a vague conceptual analogy

> Relational: Databases => Tables => Rows with Columns
> Elasticsearch: Indices => Types => Documents with Properties

###### So, what is the relation between Lucene & Elasticsearch ?

Lucene is the core & heart of Elasticsearch. It is the engine that provides all the fast searching capabilities. What Elasticsearch does is, makes it a distributed (thus scalable) system. It also provides easy to use REST APIs and lot of very useful tools & plugins, and provides frameworks like ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash & Kibana) etc.

So, if you just want to use the super-fast full-text-search capabilities on a single (not so big) data source, you can just use Lucene. If you want to make it a scalable distributed system, use other cool stuffs (like Kibana), add monitoring & visualization etc., go for Elasticsearch.

#### Installation

* Install on Windows as service
* In `config.yml`, change node and cluster name if required
* Now the APIs are available at `http://localhost:9200`
* Install plugins - Marvel as interactive GUI for monitoring clusters & query data (built on Kibana - data visualization tool)
  * Go to Elasticsearch install directory `C:\elasticsearch\bin` in command prompt
  * Type in `plugin.bat -i elasticsearch/marvel/latest`
  * Once installed, restart Elasticsearch service
  * The cluster dashboard is viewable at http://localhost:9200/_plugin/marvel 
  * The query interface is available at Sense dashboard http://localhost:9200/_plugin/marvel/sense/index.html

#### Elasticsearch Schemas or Mappings

Elasticsearch comes with default set of data types viz. `integer`, `string` (kind of the default & most used data type, internally `analyzed text`), `date` (can have time and specific format), `numbers` (can be short, byte, double, float etc.), `boolean` & `binary`. Using them, we can define schema of a `Type`. To create a schema, `POST` to the index-name path on the base API URI.

```javascript
POST http://localhost:9200/college_idx
{
	"mappings": { //schema of DB
		"student": { //type
			"properties": {
				"name": {
					"type": "string"
				},
				"registration": {
					"type": "integer"
				},
				"dob": {
					"type": "date"
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

**Note:** The `_id (string)` property is generated by default. They are also populated by Elasticsearch.
{: .notice--info}

#### Some common queries (on the APIs)

As Elasticsearch comes with full set of REST APIs, all the operations can be done with simple http REST calls.

```bash
# base uri for all queries is http://localhost:9200

# see all indices
GET /_cat/indices

# see schema of an index
GET index_name/_mapping

# insert a document
POST index_name/type_name
{
	"user_name": "AC",
	"email": "cool@code.com"
}

# read all documents from a type
GET index_name/type_name/_search

# get by _id
GET index_name/type_name/_id_string_value

# insert document with custom numeric id
# no change in schema, the string _id property can take integer too
POST index_name/type_name/id_number
{
	"user_name": "AC 2",
	"email": "cool2@code.com"
}

# retrieve with custom id
GET index_name/type_name/id_number
```






#### Clients

###### Clients for different languages

* [Official & community clients](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/index.html)

###### Elasticsearch .NET clients

* Elasticsearch.Net - low level, covering the basic elasticsearch APIs as methods
* NEST - high level wrapper over Elasticsearch.Net that provides more abstraction & strongly-typed DSL that maps 1 to 1 with the Elasticsearch query DSL
