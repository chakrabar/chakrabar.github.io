# TODO - to write about

1. Growing up as middle class India kid (the locality and people) - maybe a childhood series
2. Things our schools should teach (comm, neg, fin)
3. What made us feel that we were poor (and what looked really rich, shoes, asking parent for trivial stuffs & lecture, vacation, things other kids had, not ever be rich enough to get biryani for whole family twice a month)
4. Jumping jobs, salary, the employees, companies and managers
