#### Food in turkey

When we visit a country, its not just about the places to see, its also about the way they live, the food they eat, the mode of life there that inspires us, that makes for an enriching experience. There's no point eating your staple food in a different country rather we should try to eat like a local. There are many countries where people are scared to eat like a local because the food tastes are not typically suitable for most visitors. However turkey provides you with some of the best varieties of food that you can find in a single country. They have a wide fusion range of food that will show Asian and European influences in their food style. Turkish cuisine is all about mild flavours and richness in taste of the ingredients used. Some of the yummy eats that you should not miss while in turkey are


* **Meze platter** - Meze platter in turkey is one of its kind. It has a few varieties of salads to have with some bread.

##### Beverages

* **Çay** - The Çay (pronounced _chai_, this is simply _tea_ in Turkish) is the most popular form of tea you will find around turkey. You have the normal tea and also flavoured apple tea. In the Turkish winters this cup of cay will give you the best warmth.

* **Kaveshi** - The Kaveshi (_coffee_ in Turkish) is one of its kind, its strong and is generally served with some Turkish delight to balance the bitterness of the coffee. You should try it when you are in Turkey.

* **Raki** - The Turkish drink which is anise/fennel favoured. Its mild flavour is soothing and is unlike any drink you would have tasted.

* **Hookah** - Along with tea & coffee, Turkish people are very fond of smoking. Seems like almost every adult and most teenagers smoke cigarette. But when it comes to relaxation & delicacy, people indulge in the aromatic smoking machine - that is Hookah.
