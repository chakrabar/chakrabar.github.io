If you are a web developer, or a software developer in general, you must have heard of somethig called `WebAssembly` in last few years. If you did, but do not know actually what it is, and why you keep hearing about them - this artcle's for you. If you are already compiling your code into `wasm` and loading them into your `JavaScript` code, then, well, you'll probably not get much out of it.

If you're in the first group, jump right in. Here, we'll try to understand what is `WebAssembly`, what is the context of it, the hype vs. the fact, and a bit of the future. You might have already come across bunch of articles, blog posts, videos & even conference talks about it, but still have no clue if it's a new tool, a design pattern or a shiny new JavaScript framework!
