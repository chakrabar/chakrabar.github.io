After developing many tiny to large enterprise scale applications (tools, web, services etc.) using the `.NET Framework` for many years, I've been looking into the `.NET Core` framework for some time now. I've made some small applications from scratch, using the `.NET Core 2.0` framework, and also porting some existing, moderately large `.NET` applications to the `.NET Core 2.0` framework.

#### A series of articles on .NET Core 2.0

In this series of articles, I'll share my experience from all the recent work I have been doing. Please note, _this is not meant to give you an in depth understanding and exhasutive knowledge of the .NET Core framework_, rather I'll try to cover the basic of the new framework and some of my learning which might help fellow developers taking on a similar challenge. Also, these are NOT step-by-step DIY tutorials.

Also note, _.NET Core is farely new and is till evolving. Some of the concepts, features, syntaxes might change in future_. 

So, here is the list of articles in this series. All the articles together presents bunch of concepts, ideas etc. which can help grasp the complete state of things with .NET Core. Some of articles overlap and have shared concepts and explanations. I'd reccomend following it sequentially, but just reading them ad-hoc won't hurt much. 

##### 1. [What is .NET Core](/articles/what-is-new-in-dotnet-core/)

##### 2. [Porting existing .NET Framework libraries to .NET Core](/articles/porting-existing-libraries-to-dotnet-core/)

##### 3. [Understanding ASP.NET Core 2.0](/articles/understanding-aspnet-core-2/)

##### 4. [Porting ASP.NET MVC applications to ASP.NET Core 2.0](/articles/porting-aspnet-apps-to-aspnet-core-2.0/)

##### 5. [Porting Web API services to ASP.NET Core 2.0](/articles/porting-existing-webapi-to-aspnet-core-2.0/)

Like always, the source of knowledge has been MSDN, GitHub, Stack Overflow and other online forums.
