Welcome to the technical & everyday-life notes from AC. Here I talk about some daily tips & trick of programming. Mostly, I maintain some random developer notes. Sometimes I also write about non-technical normal everyday stuffs.

If you want to see my profile or get in touch, go to the [About](/about) section.

NOTE: Some of the posts are written by other people, as mentioned in the individual posts. I do not own or deserve any credit for those posts, they belong to their respective authors ðŸ™‚

I'm a senior developer, working mostly as Fullstack developer, but I deal with more of the back-end stuffs on a day to day basis. I write `tools`, `web apps`, `REST services` and do lot of `automation`, using `.Net`, `TypeScript`, `C#`, `JavaScript` and other related tools & technologies. I have keen interest in `Software Architecture` and I'm pretty serious about ***good design, great user experience & simple, clutter free, maintainable code***.

Check my tech-shots, or technical articles on the [Tech](/articles/) menu.

**Apart from coding**, I take great interest in `travel`, `food`, `art` & `photography`. If you too are interested in them, go check the [Blog](/blog/) menu.
